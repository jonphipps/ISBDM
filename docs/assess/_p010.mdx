## Number of units {#p010}

<section className="guid">

A manifestation may be published or produced in one or more logical or physical parts.

A manifestation inherits the conceptual parts of a work by embodying expressions of the parts. There is no intrinsic relationship between the conceptual parts and the logical or physical parts.

</section>

<section className="guid">

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
<div>

A manifestation that is a single physical part and a manifestation that has two physical parts can each embody a work or expression that has three conceptual parts.

</div>

</section>

<section className="guid">

A logical or physical part is termed a "unit" for clarity. A unit is a logical part of an intangible manifestation or a physical part of a tangible manifestation.

</section>

<section className="guid">

Assess the number and hierarchical structure of units of the manifestation.

</section>

<section className="guid">

Consider a manifestation that is an "online resource" to have more than one logical part if distinct content has its own Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that is based on the root URL of the manifestation. Consider the manifestation to have only one logical part if all content has the root URL.

The structure of a multiple unit manifestation may form a hierarchy of super-units and sub-units.

<Figure

The diagram shows a model of the hierarchy of units in a multiple unit manifestation. A manifestation that has physical or logical parts is a super-unit, and a manifestation that is a physical or logical part is a sub-unit. A unit may have more than one direct sub-unit and a super-unit. A unit is related to a sub-unit with a *has sub-unit* element and to a super-unit with an inverse *has super-unit* element.
