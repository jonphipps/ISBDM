<section className="guid">

Carry out a preliminary assessment of the manifestation before recording a description.

The assessment determines if the manifestation requires a separate description, and the granularity and completeness of the description that is required to meet the needs of the cataloguing agency.

</section>

<section className="guid">

The granularity of a manifestation description is dependent on the number of carrier and content components that are present in the manifestation. The completeness of a manifestation description is dependent on the intention to publish or produce it in a single contiguous process or in a set of discrete processes over time.

Assess the manifestation to determine the number and type of related resource entities, and to decide if they are to be associated with the manifestation, noted in the description, or omitted from the description.
</section>

<section className="guid">
The number of items that exemplify a manifestation may be indeterminate and is not generally relevant to the description of a manifestation. An instance of an item describes only characteristics that are specific to the item, including modifications that are made after its publication or production.
</section>

<section className="guid">
An instance of a manifestation may be published or produced in more than one physical or logical part.
</section>

<section className="guid">
The preliminary assessment covers three distinct characteristics that apply to every manifestation:

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Units | A manifestation may be published or produced in one or more units. |
| Expressions | A manifestation may embody one or more expressions that realise one or more works. |
| Content Change | A manifestation may embody the content of a work that is planned to be static or to change over time. |
</section>

<section className="guid">
Each characteristic meets one of two mutually exclusive conditions at the broadest level. One of the two conditions for each characteristic must apply to every manifestation:

| Characteristic | Possible Conditions |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Units | A manifestation is in either one unit or more than one unit. |
| Expressions | A manifestation embodies either one expression or more than one expression. |
| Content Change | A manifestation embodies expressions of works that are either static or are planned to be embodied over time. |

The diagram shows the possible instances of resource entities that may be related to an instance of a manifestation in an information resource.
</section>

<section className="guid">
For each assessment characteristic, determine the number of resource entities that are associated with the manifestation. Apply any mandatory stipulations, and choose one or more of the following options for each instance of a resource entity:

| Option | Description/Action |
|--------|-------------------|
| Relationship | Record an appropriate relationship element to associate the instance of a resource entity with the manifestation. |
| Note | Record an appropriate note element to describe one or more instances of a resource entity within the manifestation description. |
| Statement | Record an appropriate manifestation statement element to describe one or more instances of a resource entity within the manifestation description. |
| Omission | Omit the instance of a resource entity from the manifestation description. |

<section className="guid">
The characteristics to be assessed are mutually independent and are analysed in separate stages. The order of analyses is not important; ISBDM recommends following the order given here.

</section>

## Manifestation boundaries {#p022}

<section className="guid">

The boundary of a manifestation is the set of elements and their sub-types that distinguish the manifestation from other manifestations.

A difference in the information that is associated with these elements indicates a distinct manifestation that requires a separate description if it is to be fully described.

</section>

<section className="guid">

For a manifestation that is published and that embodies one or more expressions of one or more static works, consider the manifestation to be distinct from other manifestations if there is a significant difference in the characteristics of any of the following elements or their sub-types:

- <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1012">has expression embodied in manifestation</InLink>
- <InLink href="/docs/attributes/1022">has category of carrier</InLink> and <InLink href="/docs/attributes/1218">has media type</InLink>
- <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1217">has publisher agent</InLink>
- <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1210">has date of publication</InLink>
- <InLink href="/docs/attributes/1242">has physical characteristic</InLink>

</section>

<section className="guid">

For a manifestation that is produced and that embodies one or more expressions of one or more static works, consider the manifestation to be distinct from other manifestations if there is a difference in the characteristics of any of the following elements or their sub-types:

- <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1012">has expression embodied in manifestation</InLink>
- <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1011">has item that exemplifies manifestation</InLink>

</section>

<section className="guid">

For a manifestation that embodies the expression of a diachronic work, consider the manifestation to be distinct from other manifestations if there is a significant change in the characteristic of any of the following elements:

</section>

## Number of units {#p010}

<section className="guid">

A manifestation may be published or produced in one or more logical or physical parts.

A manifestation inherits the conceptual parts of a work by embodying expressions of the parts. There is no intrinsic relationship between the conceptual parts and the logical or physical parts.

</section>

<section className="guid">

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
<div>

A manifestation that is a single physical part and a manifestation that has two physical parts can each embody a work or expression that has three conceptual parts.

</div>
</details>

</section>

<section className="guid">

A logical or physical part is termed a "unit" for clarity. A unit is a logical part of an intangible manifestation or a physical part of a tangible manifestation.

</section>

<section className="guid">

Assess the number and hierarchical structure of units of the manifestation.

</section>

<section className="guid">

Consider a manifestation that is an "online resource" to have more than one logical part if distinct content has its own Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that is based on the root URL of the manifestation. Consider the manifestation to have only one logical part if all content has the root URL.

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

</div>
</details>

</section>

<section className="guid">

For a manifestation that is two or more unattached sheets, consider each sheet to be a part of the manifestation irrespective of the layout of the content that is embodied in the sheets.

<section className="guid">

Assess the number and dependencies of expressions that are embodied in the manifestation by using the guidance in this section. Decide which of the expressions to include in the description and the methods to use to describe them.

</section>

<section className="guid">

Consider spoken word, tactile text, or text content that is embedded in the manifestation and its packaging in order to describe itself to be a source of information only, and not to be a distinct expression that is embodied in the manifestation.

<section className="guid">

Describe the works that are realised by the expressions that are embodied in the manifestation, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata. Select the methods to use to describe each work from the following options:

- Record the work as a separate work and record a relationship to it by recording a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1220">has work embodied in manifestation</InLink> element. This shortcut element implies the existence of the expression even though it is not identified.
- Record a <InLink href="/docs/notes/1270">has note on work associated with manifestation</InLink> element that includes a description of the work.
- Record a <InLink href="/docs/statements/1025">has manifestation statement</InLink> element or element sub-type that includes information about the work.

### Manifestation that embodies more than one expression {#p016}

<section className="guid">

A manifestation that embodies more than one expression is termed an "aggregate".

</section>

<section className="guid">

Consider an aggregate manifestation to embody also an aggregating expression that realises an aggregating work. The aggregating work is the intention or plan to select the expressions that are embodied in the manifestation.

Consider the aggregating expression as having no intrinsic characteristics that are useful to describe. The aggregating expression does not inherit the characteristics of the expressions that are aggregated, and the common characteristics of the expressions that are aggregated are included in the description of the aggregating work.

</section>

<section className="guid">

<Figure

  expandLink="/docs/fullimages/x007.html"
/>

The diagram shows that there is a choice of which expressions or works to describe as separate related expressions and works and which to include in manifestation statements or notes for the manifestation that is being described. Optional entities, manifestation statements, and notes are outlined by dashes.

At least one expression or work must be described as a separate entity and related to the manifestation.

One and only one work that is embodied in the manifestation is the aggregating work. The corresponding aggregating expression is omitted for clarity.

</section>

<section className="guid">

Select the methods to use to describe each expression or work from the following options:

- Record the expression or work as a separate entity and record a relationship to it by recording a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1012">has expression embodied in manifestation</InLink> element or a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1220">has work embodied in manifestation</InLink> element.
- Record a <InLink href="/docs/attributes/1278">has extent of aggregated content</InLink> element for the kind of expression.
- Record a <InLink href="/docs/notes/1267">has note on expression associated with manifestation</InLink> element or a <InLink href="/docs/notes/1270">has note on work associated with manifestation</InLink> element that includes a description of the expression or work.
- Record a <InLink href="/docs/statements/1025">has manifestation statement</InLink> or element sub-type that includes information about the expression or work.
- Do not describe the expression or work.

Describe the expression or work with more than one method, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.

<section className="guid">

The <OutLink href="https://repository.ifla.org/handle/20.500.14598/40.2">IFLA Library Reference Model</OutLink> identifies three distinct types of aggregate:

- Collected expressions aggregate: A set of expressions of multiple independent works. The expressions may be selected according to a set of common characteristics that apply to the expressions or their works.
- Augmented expression aggregate: An expression of a single independent work that is supplemented by expressions of one or more dependent works. The augmented expression is supplemented with additional content that is not integral to the original work and does not significantly change the expression.
- Parallel expressions aggregate: A set of expressions of a single independent work.

</section>

<section className="guid">

A manifestation may be a mix of types of aggregate that are determined by the intrinsic relationships between the expressions that are aggregated and the works that they realise.

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

[Full example: <InLink href="/docs/fullex/fx050">Black Lizard big book of locked-room mysteries (2014; Vintage Books; volume; perfect binding)</InLink>. The manifestation embodies a collected set of text expressions, and text expressions that augment them.]

</details>

</section>

<section className="guid">

The main utility in describing an aggregating expression occurs when the same set of expressions is embodied in alternate manifestations or reproductions. Instead of relating each manifestation to each expression that is aggregated, the aggregating expression can be related to each expression that is aggregated via a shortcut Expression relationship element, and then related to each manifestation with a single has expression embodied in manifestation element.

</section>

<section className="guid">

If the same set of expressions is embodied in more than one manifestation with the same layout of content but with different categories of carrier, record a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1012">has expression embodied in manifestation</InLink> element for the aggregating expression. Do not record elements for the expressions that are aggregated; the expressions that are aggregated are related directly to the aggregating expression.

</section>

<section className="guid">

<Figure
  src="/img/x008.png"
  caption="Entity-relationship diagram of an aggregating expression."
  expandLink="/docs/fullimages/x008.html"
/>

The diagram shows that it can be useful to describe an aggregating expression as a separate related expression if it is embodied in more than one alternate manifestation that is published at the same time, for example in different categories of carrier, or if the same set of expressions is published at a later time. The aggregating expression is related once to each expression that is aggregated, so each alternate or subsequent manifestation may then be related to only the aggregating expression and the direct relationships with the expressions that are aggregated can be omitted. Optional entities, manifestation statements, and notes are outlined by dashes.

This satisfies the mandatory requirement for a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1012">has expression embodied in manifestation</InLink> element or a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1220">has work embodied in manifestation</InLink> element. There is a choice of which of the augmenting expressions or their works, or of the aggregating work, to describe separately, and which to include in manifestation statements or notes for the manifestation that is being described. The options for entities, manifestation statements, and notes are outlined by dashes.
