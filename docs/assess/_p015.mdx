The diagram shows that there is a choice of describing the expression or its work as separate related entities and which to include in manifestation statements or notes for the manifestation that is being described. Optional entities, manifestation statements, and notes are outlined by dashes.

Record a value of a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1012">has expression embodied in manifestation</InLink> element, or record a value of <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1220">has work embodied in manifestation</InLink> for the work that is realised by the expression. This is mandatory.

Record both elements, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.
