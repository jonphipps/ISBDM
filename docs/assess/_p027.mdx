The diagram shows the general case of an augmented expression aggregate. The augmented expression or its work is described as a separate related expression or work. This satisfies the mandatory requirement for a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1012">has expression embodied in manifestation</InLink> element or a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1220">has work embodied in manifestation</InLink> element. There is a choice of which of the augmenting expressions or their works, or of the aggregating work, to describe separately, and which to include in manifestation statements or notes for the manifestation that is being described. The options for entities, manifestation statements, and notes are outlined by dashes.

Record additional occurrences of <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1012">has expression embodied in manifestation</InLink> or <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1220">has work embodied in manifestation</InLink> elements for expressions or works that are aggregated, and of the aggregating work, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata. Use the following order of preference to select the expressions or works:

1. The aggregating work that is embodied in the manifestation.
2. Expressions that are named and given prominence in a statement of title and responsibility that appears in the manifestation.
3. Expressions that are named in a statement of title and responsibility that appears in the manifestation.
4. Expressions that are named in other statements that appear in the manifestation.
5. Expressions that are identified in the manifestation or in external sources of information.
6. Works that are realised by the expressions that are aggregated.
