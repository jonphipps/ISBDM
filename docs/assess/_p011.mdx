<section className="guid">

Consider spoken word, tactile text, or text content that is embedded in the manifestation and its packaging in order to describe itself to be a source of information only, and not to be a distinct expression that is embodied in the manifestation.

<section className="guid">

Consider a manifestation that embodies all of the parts of a larger expression and no other expressions to embody a single whole expression.

<section className="guid">

Describe the works that are realised by the expressions that are embodied in the manifestation, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata. Select the methods to use to describe each work from the following options:

- Record the work as a separate work and record a relationship to it by recording a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1220">has work embodied in manifestation</InLink> element. This shortcut element implies the existence of the expression even though it is not identified.
- Record a <InLink href="/docs/notes/1270">has note on work associated with manifestation</InLink> element that includes a description of the work.
- Record a <InLink href="/docs/statements/1025">has manifestation statement</InLink> element or element sub-type that includes information about the work.

Describe the work with more than one method, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.
