The diagram shows the general case when the work that is realised by each of the expressions that are aggregated in a parallel expressions aggregate is described as a separate related work. This satisfies the mandatory requirement for a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1220">has work embodied in manifestation</InLink> element. There is a choice of which of the aggregated parallel expressions to include in manifestation statements or notes for the manifestation that is being described. The options for entities, manifestation statements, and notes are outlined by dashes.
