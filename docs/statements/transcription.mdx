<div className="stip">
  Include honorifics and other terms of address that are associated with a name of a person in a manifestation statement, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.
</div>

  Include references to more than one instance of an entity in the statement in the order of their appearance in the statement.
</div>

<div className="stip">
  Repeat a word or phrase that is intended through typography and layout to be read twice or to be associated with more than one statement.

<div className="stip">
  Do not abbreviate or expand words that appear as full forms or abbreviations respectively in the manifestation.
</div>

<div className="stip">
  Replace indentation, new lines, and other whitespace within a statement with a single space. Add punctuation to improve clarity, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata. Do not add a punctuation mark that is the same as one that is transcribed.
</div>

<div className="stip">
  Replace an earlier form of a letter or symbol with a modern equivalent.
</div>

<div className="stip">
  Replace a ligature with its component characters, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.

<div className="stip">
  Replace a symbol or sign that cannot be reproduced by the facilities available to the cataloguing agency with an equivalent character.

<div className="stip">
  Omit words and phrases from a manifestation statement for any of the following reasons:
  
  - The text is insignificant to identify or find the manifestation
  - The text is included in another manifestation statement unless it is grammatically linked to the instance transcribed.
  - The statement is lengthy and truncation does not impair support for the user task to identify the manifestation.
</div>

<div className="stip">
  Omit words, abbreviations, or initials in a name or title that are duplicated in a fuller or shorter form within the same statement, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.

<div className="stip">
  Omit a symbol or sign that cannot be reproduced by the facilities available to the cataloguing agency.
</div>

<div className="stip">
  Use an ellipsis to indicate where content is omitted from within the manifestation statement during transcription. An ellipsis is the "mark of omission" consisting of three dots or full-stops (â€¦).
