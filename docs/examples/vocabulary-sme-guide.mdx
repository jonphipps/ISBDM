# How to Create Vocabularies: A Guide for Subject Matter Experts

*A practical, non-technical guide for librarians, catalogers, and domain experts*

## What is a Controlled Vocabulary?

A controlled vocabulary is a standardized list of terms used to describe library materials consistently. Think of it as an "official dictionary" for your domain - everyone uses the same words to mean the same things.

**Examples of controlled vocabularies:**
- **Media Types**: book, DVD, digital file, microfilm
- **Content Types**: text, image, audio, video, multimedia  
- **Subject Areas**: science, literature, history, technology
- **Languages**: English, French, Spanish, German

## Why Use Controlled Vocabularies?

‚úÖ **Consistency**: Everyone uses the same terms  
‚úÖ **Findability**: Users can locate materials more easily  
‚úÖ **Interoperability**: Systems can share and understand data  
‚úÖ **Quality**: Reduces errors and ambiguity  
‚úÖ **Multilingual**: Terms can be translated into multiple languages

## Two Methods for Creating Vocabularies

### Method 1: Simple Text Method üìù
Best for small vocabularies (under 20 terms) or when you want everything in one document.

### Method 2: Spreadsheet Method üìä  
Best for larger vocabularies, team collaboration, or when you're comfortable with spreadsheets.

## Method 1: Text Method (Small Vocabularies)

### Step 1: Plan Your Vocabulary

Before you start, answer these questions:
- **What domain does this cover?** (e.g., "content types," "media formats")
- **Who will use this?** (catalogers, end users, systems)
- **What terms do you need?** (make a rough list)
- **Do you need multiple languages?**

### Step 2: Create Your Documentation Page

Create a new documentation file with this structure:

```mdx
---
vocabularyId: "content-types"
title: "Content Type Vocabulary"
description: "Types of content found in library materials"
concepts:
  - value: "text"
    definition: "Content expressed through written language"
    scopeNote: "Includes books, articles, and written documents"
  - value: "image"  
    definition: "Visual content including photographs and illustrations"
    scopeNote: "Both digital and physical images"
  - value: "audio"
    definition: "Sound content including music and spoken word"
---

# Content Type Vocabulary

This vocabulary defines different types of content found in library materials.

<VocabularyTable {...frontMatter} />
```

### Step 3: Add Your Terms

For each term, provide:
- **value**: The term itself (e.g., "text", "audio")
- **definition**: What it means (1-2 sentences)
- **scopeNote**: Additional clarification (optional)

### Example: Library Sections Vocabulary

<VocabularyTable 
  vocabularyId="library-sections"
  title="Library Section Vocabulary"
  description="Common sections found in academic libraries"
  showTitle={true}
  showURIs={false}
  concepts={[
    {
      value: "reference",
      definition: "Materials that provide information to answer specific questions",
      scopeNote: "Includes encyclopedias, dictionaries, handbooks, and databases"
    },
    {
      value: "circulation", 
      definition: "Materials that can be borrowed from the library",
      scopeNote: "Books, DVDs, and other items with checkout periods"
    },
    {
      value: "special collections",
      definition: "Rare, unique, or historically significant materials",
      scopeNote: "Often requires special access or handling procedures"
    },
    {
      value: "periodicals",
      definition: "Magazines, journals, and newspapers published regularly",
      scopeNote: "May be in print or electronic format"
    }
  ]}
/>

---

## Method 2: Spreadsheet Method (Larger Vocabularies)

### Step 1: Create Your Spreadsheet

Open Excel, Google Sheets, or similar software and create these columns:

| Column Name | Required? | Description | Example |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `uri` | Yes | Unique ID for each term | `mediatype:T1001` |
| `rdf:type` | Yes | Always use this exact value | `http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept` |
| `skos:prefLabel@en` | Yes | The term in English | `book` |
| `skos:definition@en[0]` | Yes | Definition in English | `A written work published as printed pages` |
| `skos:scopeNote@en[0]` | No | Additional context | `Includes both fiction and non-fiction` |

### Step 2: Add Your Data

Example spreadsheet content:

| uri | rdf:type | skos:prefLabel@en | skos:definition@en[0] | skos:scopeNote@en[0] |
|-----|----------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| mediatype:T1001 | http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept | book | A written work published as printed pages | Includes both fiction and non-fiction |
| mediatype:T1002 | http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept | DVD | Digital video disc containing movies or data | Includes commercial and educational content |
| mediatype:T1003 | http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept | digital file | Electronic content stored in computer format | Various file types like PDF, MP3, JPEG |

### Step 3: Save and Upload

1. Save your file as CSV format
2. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `media-types.csv`)
3. Place it in the appropriate folder in your documentation system

### Step 4: Create the Documentation Page

```mdx
---
vocabularyId: "media-types"
title: "Media Type Vocabulary" 
description: "Physical and digital formats for library materials"
prefix: "mediatype"
uri: "http://library.org/vocabularies/media-types"
---

# Media Type Vocabulary

<VocabularyTable 
  {...frontMatter}
  csvFile="vocabularies/media-types.csv" 
/>
```

---

## Adding Multiple Languages

### For Text Method:

```yaml
concepts:
  - value:
      en: "book"
      fr: "livre"
      es: "libro"
    definition:
      en: "A written work published as printed pages"
      fr: "Une ≈ìuvre √©crite publi√©e sous forme de pages imprim√©es"  
      es: "Una obra escrita publicada como p√°ginas impresas"
```

### For Spreadsheet Method:

Add columns for each language:

| uri | rdf:type | skos:prefLabel@en | skos:prefLabel@fr | skos:prefLabel@es | skos:definition@en[0] | skos:definition@fr[0] | skos:definition@es[0] |
|-----|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| mediatype:T1001 | ... | book | livre | libro | A written work... | Une ≈ìuvre √©crite... | Una obra escrita... |

## Real-World Example: Sensory Content Types

Here's how the sensory specification vocabulary appears with rich multilingual content:

<VocabularyTable 
  vocabularyId="sensory-example"
  title="Sensory Content Specification"
  description="How content is intended to be perceived by users"
  csvFile="/data/sensory-test.csv"
  showTitle={true}
  defaultLanguage="en"
/>

**Notice these features:**
- **Search box**: Type to find specific terms
- **Language selector**: Switch between English, French, Spanish
- **Expandable details**: Click "+" to see examples, notes, and history
- **Clean presentation**: Professional formatting suitable for publication

## Best Practices for SMEs

### 1. Writing Good Definitions
‚úÖ **Do**: Use clear, simple language  
‚úÖ **Do**: Be specific and precise  
‚úÖ **Do**: Include essential distinguishing features  
‚ùå **Don't**: Use the term in its own definition  
‚ùå **Don't**: Assume specialized knowledge  

**Good**: "A book is a written work published as bound printed pages"  
**Poor**: "A book is a published book-like object"

### 2. Using Scope Notes Effectively
- Clarify edge cases: "Includes both physical and digital formats"
- Provide examples: "Such as textbooks, novels, and reference works"
- Explain relationships: "Broader than 'textbook,' narrower than 'publication'"

### 3. Organizing Your Terms
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Consider alphabetical order for browsing
- Group related terms logically
- Plan for growth and evolution

### 4. Quality Control
- Have others review your definitions
- Test with real examples
- Check for overlaps or gaps
- Validate with actual users

---

## Common Questions

### "How many terms should I include?"
Start small with core terms. You can always add more later. 10-20 terms is often a good starting point.

### "What if terms overlap?"
This is normal! Use scope notes to clarify boundaries. Consider hierarchical relationships.

### "Should I include deprecated terms?"
Yes, but mark them clearly with change notes explaining what to use instead.

### "How often should I update vocabularies?"
Review annually, update as needed. Document all changes with change notes.

### "What about abbreviations and acronyms?"
Include them as alternative labels rather than separate terms.
