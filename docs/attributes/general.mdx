<div className="stip">

  2. The prominence of values that apply to the manifestation.
  3. The order of values that appear in a statement in the manifestation.

<div className="stip">
  For a manifestation that embodies the expression of a diachronic work, and if there is a change in the information that is given in statements that describe the manifestation and appear in manifestations that embody expressions of issues or iterations of the work, record an additional occurrence of the element for the attribute that has changed, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.
</div>

<div className="stip">
  For a manifestation that embodies the expression of a diachronic work, record a <InLink href="/docs/notes/1219">has note on category of manifestation</InLink> element that gives information about a change in an attribute that is common to the manifestations that embody expressions of issues or iterations of the work, including identification of the issue or iteration in which the change first appears, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.
</div>

<div className="stip">
