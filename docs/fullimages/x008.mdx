The diagram shows that an aggregating expression can be described as a separate related expression if it is embodied in more than one alternate manifestation that is published or produced at the same time, for example in different categories of carrier. The aggregating expression is related once to each expression that is aggregated, so each manifestation may then be related to only the aggregating expression instead of the expressions that are aggregated. Optional entities, manifestation statements, and notes are indicated by dashes.
