The diagram shows a model of the hierarchy of units in a multiple unit manifestation. A unit that is broader than another unit is a super-unit, and a unit that is narrower is a sub-unit. A unit may have multiple direct sub-units, but can only have one direct super-unit. A unit is related to its sub-units with has sub-unit elements and to its super-unit with the inverse has super-unit element.
