The diagram shows the general case of an augmented expression aggregate. The augmented expression or its work is described as a separate related expression or work. There is a choice of which of the augmenting expressions or their works, or of the aggregating work, to describe separately, and which to include in manifestation statements or notes for the manifestation that is being described. The options for entities, manifestation statements, and notes are outlined by dashes.
