The diagram shows the case when the collective title identifies the aggregating work that is embodied in a collected expressions aggregate. The aggregating work is described as a separate related work. There is a choice of which of the collected aggregated expressions or their works to describe as separate related expressions and works, and which to include in manifestation statements or notes for the manifestation that is being described. Optional entities, manifestation statements, and notes are indicated by dashes.
