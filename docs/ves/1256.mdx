title: ISBDM Manufacturing Process value vocabulary
uri: http://iflastandards.info/ns/isbdm/values/1256
description: This value vocabulary is a source of values for a has manufacturing process element.
isDefinedBy: http://iflastandards.info/ns/isbdm/values/1256
scopeNote: The vocabulary does not cover the full scope of the element and may be extended with additional values.
concepts:
- value: blueline process
  definition: A production method that consists of a contact printing process based on diazonium salt and azo dye chemical reactions that renders all opaque tones or colours as blue on a neutral background.
- value: blueprint process
  definition: A production method that consists of a contact printing process based on iron salt chemical reactions that renders all opaque tones or colours as white on a blue background.
- value: burning
  definition: A production method that consists of the application of heat to mark the surface of a material.
- value: collotype
  definition: A production method that consists of a contact printing process using a dichromate chemical reaction that hardens gelatin on exposure to ultraviolet light to produce a positive master that is subsequently used in a lithographic process.
- value: daguerreotype process
  definition: A production method that consists of a photographic process using a silver-coated copper plate that is exposed in a camera and subsequently developed, usually using mercury vapour, and fixed with salt to create a positive image.
- value: embossing
  definition: A production method that consists of the use of either a metal or plastic sheet as a master with specialized equipment to produce copies for a manifestation of a tactile expression.
- value: engraving
  definition: A production method that consists of the incision of marks on the surface of a hard material using a sharp tool.
  scopeNote: Engraving includes the preparation of a printing plate for an intaglio process.
- value: etching
  definition: A production method that consists of an intaglio process in which a design is worked into an acid-resistant substance coating a metal printing plate; the plate is then exposed to acid, which etches the plate where the metal is exposed, to create lines and dark areas.
- value: inscribing
  definition: A production method that consists of a process that fixes signs and symbols onto a base material by cutting into the surface.
- value: lithography
  definition: A production method that consists of a planographic printing process in which a stone or plate is prepared using a water-repelling substance making parts of the plate receptive to ink.
- value: photocopying
  definition: A production method that consists of a macroform photoreproduction process using radiant energy in contact with or projected on opaque material.
- value: photoengraving
  definition: A production method that consists of a photomechanical process for the preparation of chemically etched printing plates.
- value: photogravure process
  definition: A production method that consists of an intaglio process in which the metal printing plate is prepared using a dichromate process to leave a gelatin resist coating of varying thickness that is etched to form cells of varying depth able to hold different amounts of ink.
- value: printing
  definition: A production method that consists of a process that transfers a pictorial or textual image from a master carrier to the surface of another carrier, often using a plate, block, stone, or screen coated with a transferable material.
  scopeNote: Includes the production of photographic prints and paper copies of stored computer data.
- value: solid dot
  definition: A production method for a manifestation of a tactile expression in which solid plastic dots are heat sealed onto the surface of thin but strong paper.
- value: stamping
  definition: A production method that consists of the application of pressure to make an impression on the surface of a material.
- value: swell paper
  definition: A production method for a manifestation of a tactile expression in which an image is printed on a special type of paper with embedded microcapsules of alcohol which burst when exposed to heat to make the surface of the paper swell up.
- value: thermoform
  definition: A production method for a manifestation of a tactile expression in which a collage master is covered with a sheet of plastic, which is heated and vacuumed to generate a copy of a model or diagram.
- value: white print process
  definition: A production method that consists of a contact printing process based on a light sensitive process that renders all opaque tones or colours as black or a colour on a white background.
- value: woodcut making
  definition: A production method that consists of a relief process in which a design is cut into and printed from the surface of a wood block.
