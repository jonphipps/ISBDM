  ISBD for Manifestation encourages the use of controlled terminology for a value of an attribute or relationship element:
    * ISBDM prescribes the use of a controlled term as a value of a specified attribute element.
    * ISBDM suggests a string encoding scheme (SES) to construct a value of a relationship element or a specified attribute element.

<div className="guid">
  A value vocabulary contains a set of controlled terms that are used as values for a specific ISBDM attribute element.

  Prescribed vocabularies for specific elements are listed in the top part of the section menu.
  Record a plural form of a controlled term where appropriate.
