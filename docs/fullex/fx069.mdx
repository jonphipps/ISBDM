# Synthesis lectures on data, semantics, and knowledge (2021-; Morgan & Claypool
              Publishers; volume)

This example describes an incomplete set of printed volumes that embodies a
              series.

The work succeeds a diachronic work with a different title. The publisher changes
              after the first year. The diachronic work is embodied in print in soft and hard
              bindings; a separate diachronic work is embodied in e-books. Not every issue is
              published in both print and e-book formats. The manifestation includes reprinted
              issues of the preceding diachronic work that retain the original numeric
              designations.

The manifestation is published in multiple sub-units.

The manifestation is a collected expressions aggregate.

The manifestation embodies a diachronic work.

The language of cataloguing is English.

The description is intended for a relational database application.
