# Medo Winnie zvani Pooh (1986; Mladost; svezak)

This example describes a printed volume of a work of fiction translated from English
              into Croatian augmented with illustrations. The translator is one of two translators
              of the work, so it is necessary to distinguish the translation expression embodied in
              this manifestation from others.

The focus of the description is the manifestation of the issue, related to the
              manifestation of the series as a super-unit. It is related to a description of the
              series as a whole, inversely related to the issue as a sub-unit.

The manifestation is published in a single unit.

The manifestation is an augmented expression aggregate.

The manifestation embodies static works.

The language of cataloguing is Croatian.

The description is intended for a relational database application.
