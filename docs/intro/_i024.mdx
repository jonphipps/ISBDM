## Manifestation entity

<div className="guid">

Manifestation is one of four entities in the <OutLink href="https://repository.ifla.org/handle/20.500.14598/40.2">IFLA Library Reference Model</OutLink> (LRM) that represent distinct aspects of an information resource. The other resource entities are Work, Expression, and Item. Manifestation and Item describe the carrier components; Expression and Work describe the content components. An information resource is described fully by at least one instance of each resource entity, and may include more than one instance of a manifestation, expression, or work. An aspect of an information resource is described fully by an instance of a resource entity, and is associated with another instance of an entity by recording a relationship element.

ISBDM provides specific relationship elements that associate an instance of a manifestation with instances of other resource entities that are aspects of the same information resource:

- <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1011">has item that exemplifies manifestation</InLink>
- <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1013">has sub-unit</InLink> and its inverse <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1014">has super-unit</InLink>
- <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1012">has expression embodied in manifestation</InLink>
- <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1220">has work embodied in manifestation</InLink>

An instance of a manifestation describes characteristics that are common to all of the items that exemplify the manifestation.

</div>

<div className="guid">

The number of instances of resource entities in an information resource is constrained by the LRM to ensure the integrity of a full description of an information resource. A manifestation is associated with:

- at least one item that exemplifies the manifestation
- none, or one or more identifiable sub-units of the manifestation
- none, or only one super-unit of the manifestation that embodies a static work
- none, or one or more super-units of the manifestation that embody diachronic works
- at least one expression that is embodied in the manifestation, and therefore at least one work that is embodied in the manifestation

</div>

<div className="guid">

A manifestation is either published or produced, depending on how the items that exemplify the manifestation are created.

</div>

<div className="guid">

The items that exemplify a published manifestation have the typical characteristics:

- There is more than one instance of item. This does not preclude a published manifestation that is exemplified by only one item
- The items are created by using a mechanical process that results in identical copies

</div>

<div className="guid">

The item that exemplifies a produced manifestation has the typical characteristics:

- There is one and only one instance of item
- The item is created by using an artisanal or hand-made process

Consider a produced manifestation to be exemplified by one and only one item.

Consider a manifestation that is created by using an artisanal or hand-made process that is augmented by a process that creates more than one item to be published.
