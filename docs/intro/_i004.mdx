### Sources of information

#### The manifestation

<div className="guid">
The manifestation itself is a unique source of information that requires special consideration.
</div>

<div className="guid">
The manifestation may describe itself and may be a source of information for the value of an element. This conforms with principle 2.3 "Representation" in <OutLink href="https://repository.ifla.org/handle/20.500.14598/80">Statement of international cataloguing principles (ICP)</OutLink>.
</div>

<div className="guid">
A manifestation describes itself with spoken word, tactile text, or text content that is embedded in the manifestation, including packaging in the form of wrappers and inserts. This content is "about" the manifestation, not "of" the manifestation, and is not treated as an expression that is embodied in the manifestation. This content includes a title or caption, a statement of responsibility, publication or production information, a table of contents, and a list of illustrations. This content excludes a preface, an afterword, or an index; these are treated as expressions.
</div>

<div className="guid">
Content about the manifestation is presented separately from the expressions that are embodied in the manifestation. It may appear before or after the expressions, between expressions, or in a border such as a header or footer that is included in the layout of the expressions.
</div>

<div className="guid">
Consider a manifestation that is reproduced in the manifestation to be an external source of information. A descriptive statement in the original manifestation pertains to the original irrespective of its presence in the reproduction.
</div>

<div className="guid">
A value taken from a statement that is presented in the manifestation must be recorded as it appears in order to conform with the principle of representation. The value must therefore appear as spoken word, tactile text, or text so that it can be transcribed and recorded. The value is transcribed as it appears even if it is known to be false as a result of error or intention.
</div>

<div className="guid">
The manifestation itself may provide differing values for an element, including multiple statements that are wholly or partially covered by the scope of the element.
</div>

<div className="guid">
The manifestation may provide the same statement in multiple languages.
</div>

<div className="guid">
The manifestation itself may emphasise one or more values over others in multiple statements for the same element. Devices for emphasis include larger font size, different font colour, and text decoration such as bold, italics, or underline. Consider such emphasis and prominence as an indication of preference within the principle of representation.
</div>

<div className="guid">
The general order of preference for selecting from multiple values within the manifestation is:

1. The value that is the most prominent.
2. The value that is the fullest within the scope of the element.
3. The value that is considered to have the most utility for users of the metadata.
   a. A value that is in a language or script preferred by the cataloguing agency.
4. The value that appears first.
</div>

<div className="guid">
The manifestation itself may not provide a value for an element.
</div>

<div className="guid">
ISBDM provides a <InLink href="/docs/statements/1025.html">has manifestation statement</InLink> element and element sub-types to record a value that appears in the manifestation. The stipulations for these elements focus on the transcription and choice of values to support the user task to identify the manifestation as it identifies itself. ISBDM provides a <InLink href="/docs/notes/1200.html">has note on manifestation statement</InLink> element and element sub-types to record uncontrolled or controlled values that complement the uncontrolled values of manifestation statements in the description.
</div>

<div className="guid">
Consider the main utility of these elements as supporting the display of the description of the manifestation. The values of these elements may be incomplete or contradictory and are suitable only for uncontrolled keyword indexing.
</div>

<div className="guid">
ISBDM provides other attribute and relationship elements and element sub-types to record appropriate values from any source of information, including statements that appear in the manifestation itself, other aspects of the manifestation that can be observed, and external sources of information. The stipulations for these elements focus on accuracy and completeness in the context of the application of the metadata.
