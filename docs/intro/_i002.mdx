## Terminology

<div className="guid">
The label of a manifestation element may include the qualifier "manifestation" to distinguish it from similar elements and labels that will be developed for the other <OutLink href="https://repository.ifla.org/handle/20.500.14598/40.2">IFLA Library Reference Model</OutLink> entities in the future.

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

The label "has identifier for manifestation" distinguishes the element from "has identifier for work", a possible future element for the Work entity. Every entity requires a similar identifier element to support entity-based cataloguing, except for Nomen which accommodates identifiers and other appellations as instances of the entity.

<div className="guid">
The label of an entity has an initial upper-case letter when it refers to the entity as a whole.
</div>

<div className="guid">
The label of an entity has an initial lower-case letter when it refers to an instance of the entity. The explicit phrase "instance of ..." is used when clarification is required.

<div className="guid">
The manifestation that is being described is referenced in stipulations as "the manifestation".

Guidance that begins "Consider ..." must be followed for effective application of stipulations.

<div className="guid">
The phrase "if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata" indicates that a stipulation is optional; if the phrase is not included, the stipulation is mandatory.
</div>

<div className="guid">
A stipulation that begins "For a manifestation that ..." applies only to a manifestation that meets the condition.
</div>

<div className="guid">
The term "value" refers to the content that is recorded for an ISBDM element.
</div>

<div className="guid">
Values in examples that are strings are enclosed in or delimited by double quote marks ("string"). A local application of ISBDM may use a different method of delimiting a string, or may not require delimiters to be recorded. Values that are linked data internationalised resource identifiers (IRIs) for things are not enclosed in double quote marks.
