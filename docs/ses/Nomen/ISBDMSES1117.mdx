For a manifestation that embodies the expression of a diachronic work, and if there is a change in the sequence of numeric designations of issues or iterations, values for the first and last numeric designations in the old sequence are separated by a hyphen "-" to indicate sequence range, followed by a value for new open sequence. Sequences are separated with semi-colons "; ".

The ISBDM string template is:

first in old sequence(`{has numeric designation}`) + "-" + last in old sequence(`{has numeric designation}`) + "; " + first in new sequence(`{has numeric designation}`) + "-"
