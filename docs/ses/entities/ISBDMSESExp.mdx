<div className="guid">

This is a suggested string encoding scheme for an authorized access point of an expression that is related to the manifestation.

The encoding scheme is applicable to the value of a <InLink href="/relationships/1002">has expression associated with manifestation</InLink> element or element sub-type.

</div>

<div className="guid">

The base access point of an expression is an authorized access point of the work that is realised by the expression.

The base access point is followed by at least one qualifier that is added to the qualifiers of the authorized access point of the work, if any, and separated by a semicolon "; ".

The ISBDM string template is:

[authorized access point of the work] + insert before ")"("; " + [a category of content of the expression])

The qualifier supports a local secondary collocation and sort order of authorized access points of expressions in a browse index for expressions.
