<div className="guid">

This is a suggested string encoding scheme for an authorized access point of a time-span that is related to the manifestation.

The encoding scheme is applicable to the value of a <InLink href="/relationships/1010">has time-span associated with manifestation</InLink> element or element sub-type.

</div>

<div className="guid">

The base access point of a time-span is a name of the time-span that is the most common in external sources of information.

`{name of the time-span}`

The base access point may be followed by a set of qualifiers enclosed in brackets "(â€¦)" and separated by semicolons "; ".

The ISBDM string template is:

[name of the time-span] + " (" + [qualifier] + "; " + [qualifier] + ")"

</div>

<div className="guid">

Add qualifiers to disambiguate the base access point.

Added qualifiers are conditional on specific characteristics of the time-span. They support a secondary collocation and sort order of authorized access points.

Use the following strings as qualifiers of a base access point:

- A category of time-span
