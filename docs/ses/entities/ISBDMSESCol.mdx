<div className="guid">

This is a suggested string encoding scheme for an authorized access point of a collective agent who is related to the manifestation.

The encoding scheme is applicable to the value of a <InLink href="/relationships/1007">has collective agent associated with manifestation</InLink> element or element sub-type.

</div>

<div className="guid">

The base access point of a collective agent is a name of the collective agent that is the most common in external sources of information.

The base access point may be followed by a set of qualifiers enclosed in brackets "(â€¦)" and separated by semicolons "; ".

The ISBDM string template is:

[name of the collective agent] + " (" + [qualifier] + "; " + [qualifier] + ")"

</div>

<div className="guid">

Add qualifiers to disambiguate the base access point.

Added qualifiers are conditional on specific characteristics of the collective agent. They support a secondary collocation and sort order of authorized access points.

Use the following strings as qualifiers of a base access point:

- A controlled term for a category of the collective agent
- A field of activity of the collective agent
- A period of activity of the collective agent, including the date of a conference, meeting, or voyage
- A place of activity of the collective agent, including the location of a conference, meeting, or voyage.
- A number or other sequence designator of a conference, meeting, or voyage
