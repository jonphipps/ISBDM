<div className="guid">

This is a suggested string encoding scheme for an authorized access point of the manifestation and of a manifestation that is related to the manifestation.

The encoding scheme is applicable to the value of a <InLink href="/relationships/1234">has access point of manifestation</InLink> element or element sub-type or a <InLink href="/relationships/1003">has manifestation associated with manifestation</InLink> element or element sub-type.

</div>

<div className="guid">

The encoding scheme uses values that are based on the elements that indicate that a manifestation is distinct.

See also: <InLink href="/assess/p022">Manifestation boundaries</InLink>.

</div>

<div className="guid">

The base access point of a manifestation is a normalized value of <InLink href="/relationships/1038">has title proper</InLink>. If there is no such value, a title supplied by the cataloguing agency may be used.

The base access point is followed by a set of qualifiers enclosed in brackets "(...)" and separated by semicolons "; ".

The ISBDM string template is:

normalised(`{has title proper}`)|[supplied title] + " (" + `{has date of creation of manifestation}`|`{has date of copyright of manifestation}` + "; " + `{has creator agent of manifestation}` + "; " + `{has category of carrier}` + ")"

If a value of a qualifier is not known, omit the qualifier from the access point.

If a qualifier has more than one value, use a concatenation of the values separated by " + " (space-plus-space). Order the values by prominence and quantity.

The sequence of qualifiers supports a standard secondary collocation and sort order of authorized access points in a browse index for manifestations.
