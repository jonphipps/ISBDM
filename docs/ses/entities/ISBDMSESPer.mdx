<div className="guid">

This is a suggested string encoding scheme for an authorized access point of a person who is related to the manifestation.

The encoding scheme is applicable to the value of a <InLink href="/relationships/1006">has person associated with manifestation</InLink> element or element sub-type.

</div>

<div className="guid">

The base access point of a person is a name of the person that is the most common in external sources of information.

Apply the guidance for the language or country of origin of the name that is available in <a class="linkOutline" href="https://www.ifla.org/g/cataloguing/names-of-persons/" target="_blank">Names of persons</a>, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.

For a name of a person that includes a family name, transpose the family part of the name to the beginning so that the base appears in a browse index in order of the family name.

The base access point may be followed by a set of qualifiers enclosed in brackets "(…)" and separated by semicolons "; ".

The ISBDM string template is:

transposed([name of the person]) + " (" + [qualifier] + "; " + [qualifier] + ")"

</div>

<div className="guid">

Add qualifiers to disambiguate the base access point.

Added qualifiers are conditional on specific characteristics of the person. They support a secondary collocation and sort order of authorized access points.

Use the following strings as qualifiers of a base access point:

- The date of birth of the person in a standard format
- The date of death of the person in a standard format
- A profession, occupation, or field of activity of the person
- A period of activity that is associated with the profession, occupation, or field of activity of the person
