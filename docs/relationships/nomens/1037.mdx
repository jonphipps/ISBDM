# has title of manifestation

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

#### Additional information

<div className="guid">
A title of a manifestation is assigned by an agent who creates the manifestation. A title of manifestation may be based on a title that is assigned by an agent who creates works and expressions that are embodied in the manifestation.
</div>

<div className="guid">
Consider a title that is assigned by an agent who owns the only item that exemplifies the manifestation to be a title of the item and not a title of the manifestation.
</div>

<div className="guid">
A title of manifestation may have one or more of the following characteristics:
  - A title may be the same string as the name or title of another manifestation or of another entity.
  - A title may be a transliteration by the cataloguing agency from a script that cannot be transcribed.
  - A title may be given in different languages and scripts in statements that appear in the manifestation or in external sources. Consider each distinct value as a separate title.
  - A title may consist of or include an initialism or a transcription or transliteration of a logo or other image.
  - A title may include numbers, punctuation marks, and symbols.
  - A title may include a statement of responsibility or edition that is integrated linguistically with the title.
  - A title may reflect the characteristics of expressions or works that are embodied in the manifestation.
