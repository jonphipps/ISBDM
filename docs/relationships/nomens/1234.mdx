# has access point of manifestation

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

#### Additional information

<div className="guid">
An access point of a manifestation is assigned by a cataloguing agency and constructed by applying a string encoding scheme to the values of attributes and relationships of the manifestation.
</div>

#### Element values

<div className="guid">
The value of an access point is a literal string (a nomen string).
</div>

<div className="guid">
Record a value that is:
  - a string that is an access point that appears in an authority file
  - a string that is constructed with a string encoding scheme
  - an IRI for the access point that appears in an authority file
</div>

##### String encoding schemes

<div className="guid">
A string encoding scheme should construct the base access point from a value of a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1037">has title of manifestation</InLink> element or element sub-type. The scheme should omit leading articles and punctuation so that the base appears in a browse index in order of the first significant word.
</div>

<div className="guid">
If no value of a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1037">has title of manifestation</InLink> element is available, a string encoding scheme should construct the base access point from a title that is assigned by a cataloguing agency.
</div>

<div className="guid">
A string encoding scheme should use values of the following elements as qualifiers of a base access point:
  - <InLink href="/docs/attributes/1022">has category of carrier</InLink> element
  - <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1217">has publisher agent</InLink> element or element sub-type
  - <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1210">has date of publication</InLink> element
</div>

<div className="guid">
A string encoding scheme should use values of any elements as qualifiers, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.
</div>

#### Stipulations

<div className="stip">
  Use the element super-type to record a less specific relationship.
  
  <details>
  <summary>Examples</summary>
  
  | Property | Value |
  |:---------|:------|
  | has appellation of manifestation | "Catalogue of shipwrecked books (2018; William Collins; volume; case binding)" |
  
  *[Full example: <InLink href="/docs/fullex/fx042">Catalogue of shipwrecked books (2018; William Collins; volume; case binding)</InLink>. The value is an access point of the manifestation.]*
  </details>
</div>

<div className="stip">
  Use an appropriate element sub-type to record a more specific relationship.
</div>

<div className="stip">
  Apply the stipulations for the element super-type unless indicated otherwise.
</div>

<div className="stip">
  Record a single occurrence of the element that is selected from one or more values that are associated with the manifestation. Use the following order of preference:
  
  1. Nomen that is an authorized access point of the manifestation
  2. Nomen that is a variant access point of the manifestation
  
  Record additional occurrences of the element, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.
</div>

<div className="stip">
  If the access point does not appear in an authority file, record a value that is constructed with a string encoding scheme.
</div>

<div className="stip">
  For an access point that is based on a title of the manifestation, and if no title appears in any statement of title and responsibility in the manifestation or in external sources of information, record a value that is based on a title that is assigned by a cataloguing agency.
  An assigned title should be concise and reflect the distinctive characteristics of the manifestation or its embodied content. An assigned title should be consistent with a language and script of the embodied text or a language and script that is preferred by the cataloguing agency.
  Record a <InLink href="/docs/notes/1273">has note on nomen associated with manifestation</InLink> element that indicates that the title is assigned.
</div>
