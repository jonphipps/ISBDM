# Related nomen entity

<div className="guid">
Nomen is an entity that is defined in the <InLink href="https://repository.ifla.org/handle/20.500.14598/40.2">IFLA Library Reference Model</InLink> as "An association between an entity and a designation that refers to it".
</div>

<div className="guid">
The designation is an appellation of an instance of the entity: a string that is used to reference the instance in a specific scheme or context. The string is labelled as a "nomen string" to distinguish it from other strings.
</div>

<div className="guid">
An appellation or nomen string includes a name, title, access point, or identifier of an entity.
</div>

<div className="guid">
The same nomen string may be associated with different instances of different entities; an instance of an entity may be associated with different nomen strings. Each unique combination of instance and nomen string is a distinct nomen.
</div>
