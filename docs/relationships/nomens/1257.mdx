# has authorized access point of manifestation

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

#### Additional information

<div className="guid">
An authorized access point is selected as the primary access point of the manifestation from all of the possible access points of the manifestation.
</div>

#### Element values

<div className="guid">
Record a value that is:
  - a string that is an authorized access point that appears in an authority file
  - a string that is constructed with a string encoding scheme
  - an IRI for the authorized access point that appears in an authority file
</div>

<div className="guid">
Record a value that is selected from one or more values of the element super-type. Use the following order of preference:
  1. The access point that is unique to the manifestation.
  2. An access point that is qualified with the most information that is available.
</div>

##### String encoding schemes

<div className="guid">
A string encoding scheme should construct the base access point from a value of <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1038">has title proper</InLink> element. The scheme should omit leading articles and punctuation so that the base appears in a browse index in order of the first significant word.
</div>

<div className="guid">
If no value of a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1038">has title proper</InLink> element is available, a string encoding scheme should construct the base access point from a title that is assigned by a cataloguing agency.
</div>

<div className="guid">
If no value of a <InLink href="/docs/relationships/1038">has title proper</InLink> element is available, and if there is only one item that exemplifies the manifestation, a string encoding scheme should construct the base access point from a title that is assigned to the item by an owner.

A string encoding scheme should use values of any elements as qualifiers, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.
</div>

For a manifestation that embodies an expression of an issue or iteration of a diachronic work, a string encoding scheme should construct the base access point from a compound title that consists of a common title and a designation and title of the sub-unit or iteration, and use a value of a <InLink href="/docs/attributes/1022">has category of carrier</InLink> element as a qualifier.
</div>
