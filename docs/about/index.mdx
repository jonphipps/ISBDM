# About ISBD for Manifestation

## About ISBDM

## Scope and purpose

The primary aim of ISBD for Manifestation is to provide the stipulations for
creating metadata description sets for the manifestation entity of the IFLA Library
Reference Model. The primary purpose is to create metadata that are compatible
world-wide, in order to aid the international exchange of metadata between and
throughout the international library and information community.

**ISBD for Manifestation** (ISBDM) is a partial
implementation of the <OutLink href="https://repository.ifla.org/handle/20.500.14598/40.2">IFLA
Library Reference Model</OutLink> (LRM).

ISBDM covers only the Manifestation entity of the LRM.

ISBDM provides stipulations and guidance for describing a single manifestation and
relating it to other manifestations and to other LRM entities.

ISBDM is designed for stand-alone use in an entity-based cataloguing
environment.

It may also be used in conjunction with other partial or complete implementations
of the LRM to provide fuller descriptions of bibliographic resources.

ISBDM metadata is intended to be interoperable with metadata from other
implementations of the LRM and LRM entities.

ISBDM has similar coverage to the consolidated ISBD which has a primary focus on
the Manifestation entity, with secondary coverage of the other LRM resource entities
Work, Expression, and Item. Most of the information recorded in a consolidated ISBD
description can be recorded in an ISBDM description, albeit in a different
structure.

## Layout and use {#abUse}

The content of ISBDM is optimised for online access. It caters for browsing in the
sequence of its presentation, for browsing in a sequence determined by a cataloguing
agency, and for instant ad hoc access to any part of its content from within and
from external documentation such as application profiles and agency policies.

The main navigation menu at the top of every page reflects the functional structure
of the standard. The introduction is followed by the four functional categories of
element, with augmentations coming last. Augmentations include controlled
terminologies (values), a glossary, and full examples.

These main components have their own internal navigation menus that are displayed
on each page. The "click-distance" between any two sections is just 2; one
click on the main menu, and another click on the sub-menu. Each section or page is
directly accessible and has a unique identifier in the form of a URL.

The sections of the introduction are arranged in order of general and theoretical
to operational. A major section is on preliminary assessment of a manifestation
before any metadata is created. This reflects the complex relationships between the
WEMI components of a resource and their impact on the stand-alone description of the
Manifestation component.

The element categories are arranged by general source of information: the
manifestation itself (statements), the cataloguer's interpretation of how the
manifestation describes itself (notes), the manifestion's intrinsic characteristics
described with pre-coordinate terminologies or notes (attributes), and the wider
consensus on how the manifestation relates to other library entities.

This is also reflected in the quantity and granularity of elements in each
category, from a small number of elements with shallow hierarchies for statements
and notes to a larger number of elements with deeper hierarchies for attributes and
relationships.

The four categories of elements and their stipulations have the same internal
layout: general stipulations for the category are followed by stipulations for each
element. The elements are arranged in alphabetical order of their English labels,
within their semantic hierarchies.

A standard layout is used for the content of each element.

An element reference card gives the definition, scope note, domain, and range of
the element, and its immediate sub-types and super-types in the hierarchy.

This may be followed by additional reference information.

The stipulations are arranged in order of general to specific.

Linking to a broader stipulation is preferred to duplicating a stipulation. The
element hierarchy is used to reduce repetition.

Stipulations are given in a standard format. A condition, if any, is stated first,
and an indication of optionality is stated last.

Examples for a specific stipulation are displayed in a standard format. Examples
can be opened and closed for display by the user. This helps to avoid page clutter
and speeds up the browsing of stipulations.

## Application {#abApp}

ISBDM stipulations support two distinct applications of entity-based
cataloguing:

- linked open data applications
- relational database applications

ISBDM stipulations assume a three-part data format for each distinct metadata
value, corresponding to the " triple" subject-predicate-object syntax used
in linked open data and the table row-column-value structure used in relational
databases.

In a single-entity standalone ISBDM cataloguing environment, the triple subject or
database table row always references an instance of the ISBDM Manifestation
entity.

utility and processing</InLink>

ISBDM is self-contained. It does not require the use of elements, stipulations, or
guidance from other standards.

Links to other standards are given for additional information.

A linked data namespace for the ISBDM elements will be available for open access in
the <OutLink href="https://www.iflastandards.info/">IFLA Namespaces registry</OutLink>.

This includes an IRI for each element, with an RDF/SKOS definition and scope notes
and hierarchical links to element super-types and sub-types.

## Related standards {#abStan}

ISBDM is related to several bibliographic metadata standards that are maintained by
IFLA or are based on an IFLA standard.

ISBDM is a content standard and element set that implements the IFLA Library
Reference Model entity-relationship model for the Manifestation entity. ISBDM
metadata is designed to be encoded in UNIMARC or the ISBDM linked data element sets
and value vocabularies in the IFLA namespace.

ISBDM metadata is designed to be interoperable with RDA: resource description and
access.

ISBDM stipulations correspond to implementation scenarios A (Linked open data) and
B (Relational or object-oriented data) of RDA.

All ISBDM elements are mapped to RDA elements, with minor differences in
granularity that arise from the more restricted scope of ISBDM.

## Background and history {#abBack}

International Standard Bibliographic Description, or ISBD, has been positioned,
from its very conception, at the centre of IFLA's programme Universal Bibliographic
Control (UBC), and as such has been charged with the task of responding to changes
in the information environment. The first standard edition of ISBD was ISBD(M):
International Standard Bibliographic Description for Monographic Publications. It
was published in 1971 as a result of international agreement on the form – printed
catalogue card, and content – areas of data elements, achieved at the International
Meeting of Cataloguing Experts in Copenhagen in 1969.

In the fifty years since, ISBD underwent constant development by expansion to cover
different types of material, from printed and manuscript publications to electronic
and web resources. The latest version was published in 2022. During this period of
change, ISBD became instrumental in the development of MARC (Machine Readable
Cataloguing) formats, and in particular to the IFLA UNIMARC: UNIversal MAchine
Readable Cataloguing Format which was first published in 1977, by providing a
content standard for its encoding structure.

The publication in 1998 of the conceptual model Functional Requirements for
Bibliographic Records (FRBR) marked the beginning of a new conceptualisation of the
bibliographic universe of UBC in sync with an entity-relationship framework as a
response to the changing technological environment. FRBR created two basic points of
departure from ISBD: the grouping of metadata around entities that reflect user
tasks and points of interest in the bibliographic universe as opposed to the linear
presentation of ISBD data; and the use of four entities (Work, Expression,
Manifestation, and Item, or WEMI) in place of a monolithic object of bibliographic
description (ISBD's "resource").

ISBD responded to the second challenge in its 2011 consolidated edition, by
including a full section in its Introduction on "ISBD and FRBR
relationship". Apart from conforming ISBD data elements with FRBR ones with
respect to mandatory and optional status, further steps in this direction were not
possible because the concepts and their terminology had become an obstacle. That is,
ISBD could not easily adopt the WEMI concepts and terms, and resolved instead to
retain "resource", as its specific terminology. In terms of FRBR,
"the ISBD is applied to describe manifestations, by means of description of the
item in hand as an exemplar of the entire manifestation".

However, ISBD did respond, within its scope, to the new technological changes. In
the section on "Purpose of the ISBD", a new aim was added, to
"enhance the portability of bibliographic data in the Semantic Web environment
and the interoperability of the ISBD with other content standards". This was a
result of activities initiated by the ISBD Review Group in 2008, and was realised by
including a list of the ISBD data elements in a special table at the end of the
"Outline of the ISBD" section. This list became the basis for publishing
an ISBD element set in Resource Description Framework (RDF), the basic syntax of the
Semantic Web, initially in the <OutLink href="http://metadataregistry.org/">Open Metadata Registry</OutLink> in
2015 and since 2020 as the ISBD Vocabularies in the <OutLink href="https://www.iflastandards.info/">IFLA Namespaces
registry</OutLink>. The decision to encompass the new online information environment and
to react to it within the scope of its purpose, so that ISBD elements can be used to
encode bibliographic data as linked open data in the Semantic web environment,
empowered ISBD's position as a relevant international content standard, not only for
human but also for machine use.

The publication in 2017 of the IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM) that superseded
the FR family of models, including FRBR, marked the full conformance of the IFLA's
conceptual model for the bibliographic universe with the current technology to
support semantic linked data. It became obvious, following the release of LRM's
draft versions, that the new model would have a significant impact on the ISBD,
which would have to undergo a major reconstruction as well as reconceptualization in
order to position itself as an implementation of the LRM. The position of the ISBD
in relation to the FRBR WEMI entities, the core entities of the LRM, was already
acknowledged in the 2011 edition. What was required was an understanding of the
direction of a "reconstruction as well as reconceptualization" of the
standard.

The ISBD Review Group set up the ISBD Manifestation Task Force in 2019 to develop
the ISBD, with the following terms of reference and deliverables:

Terms of reference

- Complete an alignment of the ISBD to the LRM at the Manifestation level, working
out an element set for that alignment.

- Analyse the gaps, i.e. the elements of the 2021 Update of the ISBD Consolidated
edition 2011; that in the cited alignment have been excluded, and that are
considered mandatory, mandatory if the information is available, or optional.

Deliverables

- The ISBD for Manifestation. That is a document consisting of:

- the ISBD to LRM Manifestation Elements Set

- a set of stipulations for describing a manifestation according to LRM

- Reflection on Transforming the ISBD into a Full Implementation of the LRM, a
working document that will constitute the basis of the future work encompassing
all of the LRM elements and other components, and which would entail rethinking
the structure of the ISBD.

The ISBD for Manifestation presents the result of the first deliverable.

The work on draft versions of the ISBD for Manifestation and issues to be solved
were presented at IFLA WLIC conferences from 2021 to 2023. Consultation was carried
out via webinars and by publishing an online "demonstrator" of an
interactive and adaptive view of the working content.

Presentations from the January 2023 webinar are available at <OutLink href="https://repository.ifla.org/handle/20.500.14598/2507">From
ISBD to ISBDM – a bibliographic standard in transformation</OutLink>.

A separate review phase for experts from related standards was added to the review
process, preceded by a webinar for invited experts held in February 2024.

The review time-frame of the ISBDM was as follows:

| Review Phase | Timeframe |
|--------------|-----------|
| ISBDM Task Force Review | from mid July until the end of September 2023 |
| ISBD Review Group Review | beginning of November until end of December 2023 |
| Experts Review | from mid February until mid April 2024 |
| Official World-wide Review | from 15 May until 15 July 2024 |

Following the ISBD Review Group members' individual review, at its January 2024
meeting the ISBD Review Group approved of the draft ISBD for Manifestation and
decided to forward it to the review of the wider interested communities.

The ISBD Review Group and the ISBD for Manifestation Task Force received responses
from 8 institutions with about 160 comments containing feedback from the expert's
and World-wide reviews. The Task Force did not see anything in the feedback delaying
the planned submission of the ISBDM to the internal IFLA standards approval process,
and the ISBD Review Group submitted the draft version of ISBD for Manifestation to
the Committee on Standards on 17th October 2024. 

To meet the second deliverable the submission to the Committee on Standards
included the document "Transforming the ISBD into a Full Implementation of the
LRM. Phase 2 alignment: ISBD for LRM. Report to the Advisory Committee on Standards,
October 2024". The report finds that, although the ISBDM can be used as a
standalone single-entity standard, the advantages for a multiple-entity ISBD
overweighs those of a single-entity ISBD, and proposes to set up a new task force
for a phase 2 of the alignment project. The report also proposes a phase 2 project
output, and a working method developed by the first phase.

The ISBD Review Group received the review with comments from the Committee on
Standards on January 2025 with recommendation to review and resubmit. The ISBD for
Manifestation Task Force edited the standard following given comments, and
resubmitted it on March 2025 to the IFLA Committee on Standards for endorsement by
the IFLA Professional Committee.
